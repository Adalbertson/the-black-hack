# Korean Translation

By 오시욱 (Siwook Oh). Current version is ``v1.0``.

Notes by Bruno Bord: The original document was a ``.docx`` I had to convert into markdown using an online converter. Although the text looked quite preserved, I had to polish the layout and look'n'feel.

I hope I didn't mess up some Korean text. If so, please contact me.
