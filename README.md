### Fix

Despite my keen eyes, I may have failed to correctly copy-paste the raw text and tables. Please ping me via this project issues or via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brunobord) or [G+](https://plus.google.com/+brunobord) if you spot any typo to be fixed.

### Translate

The main purpose of this project is to allow translations of this *open game content* into other languages.

#### How-to

Let's say you want to translate "The Black Hack" into Klingon.

##### If you know how to use Github

1. fork this project on github,
2. on your local copy, create a `klingon` directory,
3. in this directory, create a ``meta.yaml`` file. This file is plain text and should be exactly like the [english/meta.yaml](english/meta.yaml) file, See the "meta" for more details.
4. in this directory, create a `the-black-hack.md` file and start translating. This file should fit the [Github Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) syntax,
5. Don't forget to add your name in the LICENSE file, in the last section ``"15 COPYRIGHT NOTICE"`` like this: *"Klingon translation Copyright 2016, B'Elanna Torres"*.
5. when you're done, submit a [pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/),
6. there may be a few discussion about your translation (mostly about the Markdown syntax). When the pull-request is "ok", it'll be merged into the main repository.

##### If you don't know how Github is working

Contact me via [e-mail](http://jehaisleprintemps.net/contact/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brunobord) or [G+](https://plus.google.com/+brunobord) or any mean you can find and send me over a **raw text** translation of the game. I'll try to add it to the project ; and I may ask you to eventually help me to integrate it as best as possible.

Congratulations, you have contributed to this project

#### Make sure your contribution is okay

If you're geeky enough, you can try to use the command: ``make html`` to build HTML pages into the `build/` directory. It only requires that (a recent version of) [tox](http://tox.readthedocs.org/) is available on your system.

Browse the `build/` directory with your web browser to see your translation along with the others.

#### The Meta file

The meta file is a [YAML](http://yaml.org/), but it shouldn't be a problem. Your "klingon" meta file should look like this:

```yaml
label: Klingon
author: B'Elanna Torres
version: '1.1.2'
```

**Important**

* All the field **names** are case-sensitive, so be careful if you're writing this file yourself.
* The meta file is completely optional, but it'll help improve the look'n'feel of the homepage.
* None of the fields are required you can only specify one, two or all of them ; your choice.
* even though the `author` information is optional, although I'd recommend to provide it, in order to receive feedback (including praises from the community).

### Specific styles

**Note:** If you think that the following is too complicated for you, don't worry, I'll take care of this.

In order to get the "Converting saves" tables aligned and pretty, we're using the following CSS style:

```css
#converting-saves + p + table, #converting-saves + p + table + table {
    display: table;
}
```

It might look a bit complicated, but it goes like this: it's using the *anchor name* of the "Converting saves" header, skips the next paragraph, and changes the `display` CSS attribute for the next two tables.

Whenever you're adding a new language directory, or if you're modifiying your translation of "Converting saves", the anchor name also changes, if you want the styles to fit.

Let's say I'm adding French. The translation reads "Conversion des jets de sauvegarde". The anchor name will be: `conversion-des-jets-de-sauvegarde`. To check it, just build the HTML files and go to this specific section. The anchor link would appear when you roll your mouse over the "Â¶" sign next to the title.

In order to have the next two tables correctly aligned, here's my new CSS instructions:

```css
#converting-saves + p + table, #converting-saves + p + table + table,
#conversion-des-jets-de-sauvegarde + p + table, #conversion-des-jets-de-sauvegarde + p + table + table {
    display: table;
}
```
