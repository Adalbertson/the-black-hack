# The Black Hack

This project publishes the "raw text" of the Roleplaying game "The Black Hack", by David Black. As specified in the [License](LICENSE) document, the text and tables are *open game content*.

It means that anyone can use this *open game content* and make derivative works without asking for permission, as long as this derivative fits the [Open Gaming License terms](http://www.opengamingfoundation.org/ogl.html).

### Fix

Despite my keen eyes, I may have failed to correctly copy-paste the raw text and tables. Please ping me via this project issues or via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brunobord) or [G+](https://plus.google.com/+brunobord) if you spot any typo to be fixed.

### Translate

The main purpose of this project is to allow translations of this *open game content* into other languages.

#### How-to

Let's say you want to translate "The Black Hack" into Klingon.

##### If you know how to use Github

1. fork this project on github,
2. on your local copy, create a `klingon` directory,
3. in this directory, create a `the-black-hack-klingon.md` file and start translating. This file should fit the [Github Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) syntax.
4. When you're done, submit a [pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
5. There may be a few discussion about your translation (mostly about the Markdown syntax). When the pull-request is "ok", it'll be merged into the main repository.

##### If you don't know how Github is working

Contact me via [e-mail](http://jehaisleprintemps.net/contact/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brunobord) or [G+](https://plus.google.com/+brunobord) or any mean you can find and send me over a **raw text** translation of the game. I'll try to add it to the project ; and I may ask you to eventually help me to integrate it as best as possible.

Congratulations, you have contributed to this project
