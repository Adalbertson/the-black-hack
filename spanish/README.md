Notes by Bruno Bord: to convert this document into markdown, I went from HTML to github-flavored markdown using ``pandoc`` and thereafter reformatting everything.

The pandoc command was the following:

```
pandoc the-black-hack.txt -f mediawiki -t markdown_github --atx-headers > the-black-hack.md
```
